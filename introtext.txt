They told you the freighter was safe.  The shipping lanes had seen more piracy lately, but the pilot swore he could outrace them.  They didn’t bother splurging for an escort, and better weapons would have wiped their margin clean.

You knew better.  You hadn’t boarded a commercial flight in years without an emergency pressure suit stashed in your carry-on.  After all, it’s not paranoia if you really are surrounded by incompetents.

You sprang into action the moment the klaxons went off, sealing the suit as you ran for the escape pods – but the hull blew out before you reached safety, sending you spiralling out into space. 

The freighter exploded behind you, showering local space with debris.


Now, you have nothing.

But maybe you can salvage something from this wreck.
